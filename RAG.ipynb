       "\n",
       "### **Key Stages in the Evolution of Language AI**  \n",
       "1. **Bag-of-Words (1950s–2000s)**  \n",
       "   - Early approach focused on counting word occurrences in text.  \n",
       "   - Ignored semantic meaning and context.  \n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Dense Vector Embeddings (2013)**  \n",
       "   - Introduced by **Word2vec**, which used neural networks to represent words as vectors.  \n",
       "   - Captured semantic relationships (e.g., \"king – man + woman ≈ queen\").  \n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Attention Mechanisms (2014–2017)**  \n",
       "   - Enhanced Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by allowing models to focus on relevant parts of input text.  \n",
       "   - Paved the way for the **Transformer architecture** (Vaswani et al., 2017), which revolutionized NLP.  \n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Modern LLMs (2018+)**  \n",
       "   - Two dominant architectures emerged:  \n",
       "     - **Encoder-only models (e.g., BERT)**: Optimized for understanding language (e.g., classification, semantic search).  \n",
       "     - **Decoder-only models (e.g., GPT)**: Specialized in generative tasks (e.g., text completion).  \n",
       "   - Scale exploded (e.g., GPT-1 had 117M parameters; GPT-3 reached 175B).  \n",
       "\n",
       "### **Training Paradigms**  \n",
       "- **Pretraining**: Self-supervised learning on vast text corpora (next-token prediction).  \n",
       "- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapts models to specific tasks:  \n",
       "  - **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Uses labeled data for instruction-following.  \n",
       "  - **Preference Tuning**: Aligns outputs with human preferences (e.g., safety, quality).  \n",
       "- **Efficient Methods**:  \n",
       "  - **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: Updates only small subsets of parameters (e.g., LoRA, QLoRA).  \n",
       "  - **Quantization**: Reduces computational costs (e.g., 4-bit precision with QLoRA).  \n",
       "\n",
       "### **Applications & Challenges**  \n",
       "- **Applications**: Chatbots, document retrieval, multimodal systems, and more.  \n",
       "- **Considerations**: Addressing bias, transparency, harmful content, and intellectual property.  \n",
