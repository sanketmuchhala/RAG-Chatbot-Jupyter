# Just Practicing — RAG, AI, and Some Notebooks

Hey there,

This repo is just me experimenting and learning how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) works — especially in a data exploration context.

You'll probably find a bunch of Jupyter notebooks in here doing things like:
- Talking to CSVs using DeepSeek-R1
- Summarizing datasets
- Answering natural language questions about data
- Recommending and generating visualizations
- Basically trying to make something that feels like a real data analyst you can chat with

Nothing production-grade here — just me boarding the RAG train and seeing how far I can go with it.

Feel free to explore, fork, or say hi.
