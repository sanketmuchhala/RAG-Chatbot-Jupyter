Welcome! This notebook is a hands-on, well-documented walkthrough to help you practice core LangChain concepts in a friendly, human-written style.

What you'll do:
- Understand the building blocks: models, prompts, chains, memory
- Create useful chains with `ChatPromptTemplate` and output parsers
- Try basic memory for multi-turn conversations
- (Optional) Explore tools/agents
- Build a tiny Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demo

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.10+
- An OpenAI API key (optional but recommended for realistic outputs). If you don't have one set, the notebook will fall back to a “fake” local model so you can still practice the workflow.

Tips:
- Run cells top-to-bottom the first time
- If you change package versions, occasionally restart the kernel
- Skim the big-picture headings; then dive into the code cells and play!
