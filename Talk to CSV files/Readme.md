# AI Data Analyst Agent

This Jupyter-based AI agent acts like a **conversational data analyst**, capable of reading and understanding a CSV dataset, answering questions about it, recommending and generating visualizations, and maintaining memory across multiple queries — all using the power of **DeepSeek-R1** and **LangChain**.

---

## Features

- **Automatic dataset summarization**
- **Natural language question answering** (via DeepSeek-R1)
- **Semantic context retrieval** using FAISS
- **Multi-turn conversation memory** (LangChain)
- **Chart suggestion and generation** using seaborn/matplotlib
- **Interactive chat interface** for step-by-step exploration

##  Project Structure

| Component       | Purpose                                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `pandas`        | Data loading and manipulation                          |
| `seaborn`/`matplotlib` | Visualization and charting                     |
| `faiss`         | Local vector store for semantic search                 |
| `TfidfVectorizer` | Embedding column summaries                          |
| `DeepSeek-R1`   | Natural language understanding + generation            |
| `LangChain`     | Maintains memory of chat history across turns          |

## Example Queries

- “Which region has the highest profit?”
- “Show the trend of sales over time.”
- “How are discounts and profit related?”
- “Plot a boxplot of profit by category.”
- “Are there any columns with missing values?”

---

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo or copy the `.ipynb` notebook into your Jupyter environment.
2. Replace the placeholder `API_KEY` with your **DeepSeek-R1 API key**.
3. Run the cells one by one.
4. At the end, interact with the chatbot by typing in your questions.

## Requirements

Install the following packages before running:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib faiss-cpu langchain tiktoken requests
````

---

##  DeepSeek API

You will need an API key from [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com/) to use the LLM functionality.

---

##  Visualization Types Supported

* Bar chart
* Line chart
* Box plot
* Scatter plot
* Histogram

Charts are generated automatically when the model suggests them in the response.

---

## Limitations

* Only one dataset is active per session
* Assumes basic CSV structure with headers
* Chart type detection is rule-based (can be upgraded to structured output parsing)
